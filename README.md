# Spring Engine for Prog&Play
This repository contains the source code of the modified Spring Engine to make it work with the [Prog&Play API](https://github.com/Mocahteam/ProgAndPlay). You can find more information about the Prog&Play project at this address : http://progandplay.lip6.fr/index_en.php.

The repository is divided in two folders : one of them contains the code of the modified Spring Engine 0.82.5.1 (which is the original and official version on which Prog&Play has been integrated), the other contains the upgrade of the aforementioned code for the 100.0 version (this version is currently unstable, please use the previous one).
